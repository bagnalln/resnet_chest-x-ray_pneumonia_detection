# ECE 5831 Final Project: Chest X-Ray Pneumonia Detection Using ResNet and Transfer Learning

## Introduction

This project is a continuation of my midterm project reviewing and experimenting with ResNet and ImageNet. The goal of this project is to implement ResNet in a real use case on a real dataset, specifically on detecting Pneumonia in chest x-rays from [this Kaggle dataset]('https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia') with at least 80%+ accuracy.


## Results

Final accuracy over the test dataset was 93.1, f1 score of .944
